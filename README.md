# Steam Stalker

## Introduction

This is a web application designed to provide a better view into the data that Steam provides.  The primary goals are to provide a simple overview of:

1. A player's most played games
1. A player's latest game playing
1. Information of the same for a player's specified friends

## TODO

1. Create rake task to run nightly and update all libraries
1. HTML skinning
1. QA testing - specifically around creation of invalid or non-existant SteamIds
1. General code cleanup
